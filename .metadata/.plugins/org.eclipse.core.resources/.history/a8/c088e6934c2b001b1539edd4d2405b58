/*
Given an array, find the number of Arithmetic subsequences that are possible from it.
Arithmetic subsequence is a subsequence of length greater than or equal to 3 and is an arithmetic progression.

Eg:
I/P: [2,4,6,8,10]
O/P: 7
(sequences -> [2,4,6],[4,6,8],[6,8,10],[2,4,6,8],[4,6,8,10],[2,4,6,8,10],[2,6,10] )
