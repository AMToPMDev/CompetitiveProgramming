You are lost in a dense jungle and it is getting dark. There is at least one path that leads you to the 
city on the other side but you cannot see anything until you are right in front of it as the trees and 
bushes obscure the path.

Devise an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the way out. Your goal is to go out of the jungle as fast 
as you can before it gets dark.
