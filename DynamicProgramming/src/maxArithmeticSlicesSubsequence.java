/*
Given a list of numbers, find the maximum number of arithmetic slices possible.

An arithmetic slice is one following below conditions:
i.  It should contain atleast 3 elements.
ii. Distance between every two elements should be same.

Eg:

arr: 2 4 6 8 10

Ans: 7

[2,4,6],[4,6,8],[6,8,10],
[2,4,6,8],[4,6,8,10],
[2,4,6,8,10],[2,6,10]
